Game

Have hallways that the player can use as shortcuts to access rooms that spawn the bot enemies.
These hallways come from the crystal room and the player can turn off the bots spawning there.

Task List:
	Get the CreepData objects to put their data into the CreepScript objects when the player enters that room.

Musts
	Give the boss an intro and outro
	Make enemies respawn upon entering room

Wants
	Maybe the player needs to go through all endings in sequence?
	Maybe I shouldn't put all of these ideas into this game, and could put them into a few games

	Funny Stuff
		Ending
			If the player reaches the end without blowing up the wall to find the dungeon core, 
			there is are cutscenes that play to tell the player to go back and do that
				1st time:
					Self avatar tells the player "No, no, no. Go back, blow up the wall, and play the rest of the game!"
					The player is then sent back to the room
				2nd time:
					Avatar tells the player "What did I tell you! You're missing out on a lot of content! Go back and blow up that wall!"
					Player is sent back to room with a bomb chute nearby
				3rd time: 
					Avatar tells the player "..."
					Player appears in the room, and a bomb comes in from the side, hitting the player, landing in front of the wall, blowing up to reveal the hole
				4th time:
					Avatar: "Fine!"
					The player is then only able to watch as their character is played to play out the rest of the game

	Normal ending
		Overly standard ending where the player is told they vanquished the bad guy and peace came to the land
		This is not true, and the monsters just return at the end of the hero's life
	Actual ending
		The pool actually dies, and then eveything dies

	Intro story
		Show text
		Fade from black
	Intro scene
		Show hero come in
		Show boss rise from the center

Boss
	Damage anim
	Damage sound effect
	Health bar graphic
	Death Anim

Creeps
	AI
		Melee Attacks
		Ranged Attacks
		Beast Walk
		Humanoids Walk
		Have creeps move together when they bump into each other, one is the leader, the other follows
			Have other creeps that bump into a follower take on the leader as well
			When the leader moves, all of the children then move
			This could result in the gridlock problem, where a follower is blocking the leader's path (except that I'm using forces?)
			A leader that bumps into a follower will not take themselves as a leader (or everyone is their own leader by default)
			A leader that bumps into a follower will take on that follower's leader, and then cascade that to all of their own followers
